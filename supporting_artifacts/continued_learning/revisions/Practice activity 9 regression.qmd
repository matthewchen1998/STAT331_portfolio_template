## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(here)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
animal<-read_csv(here("week 9", "mystery_animal.csv"))
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
animal_lm<-lm(weight_after~weight_before, data = animal)
```

```{r}
animal_lm|>
  broom::augment()|>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = .resid, x = .fitted))+
  geom_point()
```
