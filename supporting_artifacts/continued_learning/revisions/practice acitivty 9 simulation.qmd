## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
a = 1.5
b = 3.5
range<-seq(a,b)
trumpt_weight<-punif(range, a, b)
print(trumpt_weight)

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
set.seed(1957)

music_man <- function(n_tromb, n_cor, n_reed){
  
  trombones <- rnorm(n_tromb, mean = 4.6, sd = 0.8)
  cornets <- runif(n_cor, min = 1.5, max= 3.5 )
  reeds <- rchisq(n_reed, 4)
  total_weight<- sum(trombones,cornets, reeds)
  return(total_weight)
  
}

my_weights <- map_dbl(.x = 1:1000, 
                      .f = ~ music_man(n_tromb = 76, n_cor = 110, n_reed = 1035)
                      ) 
sum(my_weights<4532)

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
